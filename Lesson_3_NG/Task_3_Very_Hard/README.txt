In this game I have implemented
-Inventory - key 'i' opens inventory
-Craft - To do this, go to the inventory (the "i" key) and press the "c" key, 
	 after that you need to go to the position and press the "r" key
-Extraction of resources - you can use special tools and press the r key, 
    no tools are needed for the tree (yes, our character breaks them with his hand, he is very strong)
-Building houses - In this game, you can build a mine 
    (we collect the necessary resources and press the m key, you can only build at the top) 
    and a door to hell (we collect the necessary resources and press the h key, you can only build at the top)
- We win only when we enter hell)
- The entrance to the premises is carried out by pressing the letter r
